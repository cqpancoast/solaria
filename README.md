Solaria is (or will be) a framework that anyone can build on to develop their own
interactive storytelling applications, along with a collection of software
that makes this easier.

## What can it do?

You (yes, you!) can use Solaria to design:
- a text-based game engine with a visual editor, conditional logic, and HTML/Javascript support, like [Twine](https://twinery.org)
- a backend component of a video game that keeps track of choice-based player action and then communicates the effect of those choices back to the game proper
- [Zork](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork), and/or your own program to make more games just like it

Despite its text-based focus, Solaria is _view agnostic_, meaning that the
framework is built for any arbitrary input and output. Potentially, the
designed program could have a dog tap a place on a map as input, to which
the program responds by [asking your computer to produce a smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelling_screen).
The possibilities are limitless!

## How does it work?

### The Solaria Framework

The Solaria framework (just "the framework" from here on out) is a collection of "template classes" and rules for how they interact. That's it! The beauty of this over interactive storytelling software like [Twine](https://twinery.org) or [Inform](http://inform7.com) is that if you think you can do better than the developers, you're welcome (and encouraged) to! If you think other people will like it, you'll be able to post it to a place where other people can access it.

But this is all very abstract. Let's get concrete.

The framework can be thought of as a giant chain that goes from the writer to the reader, the two end users of your program.

A more complete data definition can be found in this sub-README [here](src/README.md).

### Software Collections

This will be a place where all framework implementations (and other things that might assist in the creation of story software) will go. It doesn't exist yet, but it will soon.

## Where do I start?

Why don't you take a look through our extensive [tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination)!

## How can I help?

If you'd like to contribute a framework component implementation to the Software Collections, you're welcome to post stuff on the website. If you'd like to work on the Software Collection or the framework itself, [email me](mailto:cqpancoast@gmail.com) and we'll figure something out.
