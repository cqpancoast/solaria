Solaria is (or will be) a framework that anyone can build on to develop their own
interactive storytelling applications, along with a collection of software
that makes this easier.

## What can it do?

You (yes, you!) can use Solaria to design:
- a text-based game engine with a visual editor, conditional logic, and 
HTML/Javascript support, like [Twine](https://twinery.org)
- a backend component of a video game that keeps track of choice-based player 
action and then communicates the effect of those choices back to the game 
proper
- [Zork](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork),
and your own program to make more games just like it

Despite its text-based focus, Solaria is _view agnostic_, meaning that the
framework is built for any arbitrary input and output. Potentially, the
designed program could have a dog tap a place on a map as input, to which
the program responds by [asking your computer to produce a smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelling_screen).
The possibilities are limitless!
