# A Builder for GraphReadingModel.
# Takes in (one of, not sure yet):
# - GraphStoryModel, StartParagraphID, ReaderParams
# - StartParagraph, ReaderParams
# - Also should ReaderParams be the actual reader dictionary object
#   itself or should it be put into this class by specifying stuff
#   property by property? Idk man we'll figure it out. TODO
class GraphReadingModelBuilder:

    # Initializes this GraphReadingModelBuilder with no properties.
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # def specify stuff

    # Builds a GraphReadingModel.
    def build(self):
        return  # self.graph_reading_model
